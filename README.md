Random repository I've forked for adding SecureKeys as an example.

Please see this commit to see how to fully add it: https://github.com/saantiaguilera/android-app-SecureKeys-example/commit/1e08e754e4cf21063b826611c2a0cc27a45ff491

Known issues:
1. When first added, android studio sync might throw an exception with "CMakeLists not found..", simply run something in the gradle daemon (`./gradlew build`) for example, and it should be fixed

TESting webhooks!
